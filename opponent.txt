Yesterday: Xcode => nothing good came out of it. Today: Rubymotion => almost finished an app.

RubyMotion lets you quickly develop and test native iOS apps, all using the awesome Ruby language you know and love.

If you want to see an example of a clean and well-structured RubyMotion app, check out https://github.com/foeken/CarenMotion … by @dreetje


mattlanham: If you’re looking to build an iOS app check out @RubyMotion. Cleaner syntax. As fast as obj-c. Loving it!

Justin Mazzi ‏@jmazzi
RubyMotion is pretty great. No Xcode or Interface Builder, I interact with my app via rake and I get to use Vim.

@RubyMotion Love, absolutely needed.


After years of iOS work, RubyMotion seems like a thousand kittens playing the piano while sliding down a double-rainbow.

This is AWESOME! With just minimal iOS experience, I was able to get a working app up and running on my phone. Oh, the feeling of power!

So I'm sitting here coding up a RubyMotion app and I *love* it. LOVE IT. I have a few annoyances to work out, but man I'm loving this.


qrush: Hey Basecamp users! @37signals has a new iPhone app you want. (Also it’s written in RubyMotion!) Apply for the beta: https://t.co/eaQE7ERm

The @RubyMotion app I wrote just hit the app store today. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fanboat/id592162965?mt=8&ls=1 …
